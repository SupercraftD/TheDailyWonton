          <b>What is The Wonton?</b>
          The Wonton is a public news outlet that lets EVERYONE write their own article. However, to make sure new articles are read and not just drowned by all the other new ones, only one article can be written a day. It's first come first serve, so be the first to write an article and have everyone else read it!
